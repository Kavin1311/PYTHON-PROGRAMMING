# EXP 1.
## The boys Surya and Vijay had been playing switch and swap every time it suited their fancy since they had shared two balls. They had a temporary basket to drop the ball for swapping from each other.  

## AIM:
To write a python program for swapping of two variables

## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED:
PC Anaconda - Python 3.7

### Step 1:
Get the two values from the user

### Step 2:
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable

### Step 3:
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.

### Step 4:
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable

### Step 5:
Print both the values it would be interchanged

### Step 6:
End the program

## PROGRAM:
```
x = eval(input())
y = eval(input())
temp = x
x = y
y = temp
print("Swapped values are:",x,y)
```
## OUTPUT:
